The Player class should receive a name (string), a hp (int), and a mp (int) upon initialization. The Player also has 2
instance attributes: skills (an empty dictionary that will contain the skills of each player and its mana cost) and a
guild set to "Unaffiliated" by default.
The Player class should also have two additional methods:

- add_skill(skill_name, mana_cost)
  o Adds the skill and the corresponding mana cost to the dictionary of skills. Returns "Skill
  {skill_name} added to the collection of the player {player_name}"
  o If the skill is already in the collection, returns "Skill already added"
- player_info()
  o Returns the player's information, including their skills, in this format:

"Name: {player_name}
Guild: {guild_name}
HP: {hp}
MP: {mp}
==={skill_name_1} - {skill_mana_cost}
==={skill_name_2} - {skill_mana_cost}
...
==={skill_name_N} - {skill_mana_cost}"

The Guild class receives a name (string). The Guild should also have one instance attribute players (an empty
list which will contain the players of the guild). The class also has 3 additional methods:

- assign_player(player: Player)
  o Adds the player to the guild and returns "Welcome player {player_name} to the guild
  {guild_name}". Remember to change the player's guild in the player class.
  o If he is already in the guild, returns "Player {player_name} is already in the guild."
  o If the player is in another guild, returns "Player {player_name} is in another guild."
- kick_player(player_name: str)
  o Removes the player from the guild and returns "Player {player_name} has been removed
  from the guild.". Remember to change the player's guild in the player class to
  "Unaffiliated".
  o If there is no such player in the guild, returns "Player {player_name} is not in the
  guild."
- guild_info()
  o Returns the guild's information, including the players in the guild, in the format:
  "Guild: {guild_name}
  {first_player's info}
  ...
  {N player's info}"
